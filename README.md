# 🌕 Werewolves on the Clocktower 🏰

## A brand-new way to play Werewolf of the Miller’s Hollow!

**Werewolves on the Clocktower** is a clandestine project inspired by the simple rules and characters of *Werewolf of the Miller’s Hollow*, enhanced with selected mechanics from *Blood on the Clocktower*.  

The goal is to create a more interactive experience that relies heavily on communication and bluffing. Each player takes on a complex and engaging role, while the game remains intuitive for first-time players. It stays familiar to fans of the original *Werewolf of the Miller’s Hollow* and, importantly, gives players a reason to remain involved even after death, so no one feels left out of the fun.

## The Goal

This repository aims to create a web-based adaptive script for the Game Master.

Because of the game’s complexity, it is usually run by two GMs. Typically:
- One GM reads the script and interacts directly with the players (tapping them, showing cards, etc.).
- The second GM gathers and records all necessary information.

This script is designed to help the reading GM by providing a constantly updated version of the script that adapts to in-game actions and characters. In the future, it may reduce the workload of the assisting GM, or even replace the need for a second GM entirely.

## Languages

The game is currently available in EU Portuguese.  

Future plans include French and English versions. The long-term goal is to make the repository more versatile by providing rule manuals in multiple languages.

The current updated list of characters and script can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aV9II9br_8ln4zrA7wgHRByBLqyb8EzkOqc2ltHGCes/edit?usp=sharing).
